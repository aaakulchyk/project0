Animated Head | Site about Animation
Author - Andrei Kulchyk, 2018

This site is dedicated to animation, some cartoons, as well as Disney's twelve
principles of animation. The topic were chosen based on that I just newly
learned about the Disney's principles, so they quickly came to my mind.

In the development process Bootstrap 4.1 and Dart Sass
were used as part of the project's specification.
